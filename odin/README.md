Odin is a Discord bot which handles the administrative (and sometimes political) needs of certain video games that require large (25 or more) groups of players with which to succeed.

Discord is a VoIP, communication and pseudo social media application, mostly tailored to gamers, although it does see significant use as simply a communication app (as comparable to other apps of this function such as Telegram, Whatsapp, Kik, etc).

Odin is written in Java, using the Discord4J library to interface with Discord's API.
