Odin is a Discord bot which handles the administrative (and sometimes political) needs of certain video games that require large (25 or more) groups of players with which to succeed.  The version presented in this example is one iteration, but is usually modified by a simple search and replace/refactoring for different games.

Discord is a VoIP, communication and pseudo social media application, mostly tailored to gamers, although it does see significant use as simply a communication app (as comparable to other apps of this function such as Telegram, Whatsapp, Kik, etc).

Odin is written in Java, using the Discord4J library to interface with Discord's API.
