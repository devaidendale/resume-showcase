# Warlock Engineering - Blade Calculator

This was a simple project for Warlock Engineering to allow customers to specify the wingspan of the windmill blades they wished to purchase.  The app would calculate several things such as the potential power generation and optimal wind speed and then graph them using Google's chart API and save their selection into an SQL database.

The code is presented as example only.
