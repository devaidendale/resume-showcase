# StarCiv

<b>The files presented here are for portfolio example only.</b>

StarCiv was one of the final individual projects at AIE.  It was a 3D 'game' I made when I was slightly obsessed with Civilization[sic] 5 so it was designed like a 4x strategy game.  It showcased the A* pathfinding algorithm using a hexagonal mapping system, although graphics was also shown off.  It was written in C# / XNA.
